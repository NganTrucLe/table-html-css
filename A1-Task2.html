                        Paris is a city that'll never stop being a source of great intrigue, 
                        as travelers from far and wide descend upon the French capital to see what

                        felt worldwide, but with the fascination also comes some negativity.</p>

                        London has something for everyone: from history and culture 
                        to fine food and exceedingly good times. 2000 years of history 
                        has made the ‘Big Smoke’ deeply cosmopolitan and exotic. 
                        With such diversity, London’s cultural dynamism makes it 
                        among the world’s most international cities.

                        From the patisseries of Papeete to the Marquesan bird dance, 
                        Tahiti mixes French influence with Polynesian culture. 
                        Even in winter, Tahiti’s balmy temperatures mean you never get cold between swims. 
                        Snorkelling and diving offer time to appreciate the colourful coral and fish, sea turtles, 
                        stingrays and reef sharks, and between July and November is a great time 
                        to see spectacular humpback whales and their young. 
                        Don’t miss paddling an outrigger canoe, 
                        a favourite pastime of local residents.
